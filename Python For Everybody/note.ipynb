    "6. interpret: To execute a program in a high-level language by translating it one line at a time.\n",
    "7. low-level language: A programming language that is designed to be easy for a computer to execute; also called “machine code” or “assembly language”.\n",
    "8. machine code: The lowest-level language for software, which is the language that is directly executed by the central processing unit (CPU).\n",
    "9. main memory: Stores programs and data. Main memory loses its information when the power is turned off.\n",

    "15. prompt: When a program displays a message and pauses for the user to type some input to the program.\n",
    "16. secondary memory: Stores programs and data and retains its information even when the power is turned off. Generally slower than main memory. Examples of secondary memory include disk drives and flash memory in USB sticks.\n",
